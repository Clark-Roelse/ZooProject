<h1>The Cheetah</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/cheetah">
    The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal. With acceleration that would leave most automobiles in the dust, a cheetah can go from zero to 60 miles an hour in only three seconds. Wild cheetahs are thought to be able to reach speeds of nearly 70 miles an hourâ€”although they can only sustain that speed for about 30 seconds. These cats are nimble at high speeds, able to make quick and sudden turns in pursuit of prey.</blockquote>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p> The cheetah can be found both in africa and asia. They are found on the plains and grasslands in these places.</p>
